# Customer_Behavior_analysis
Retail customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL and Power BI, uncovering Data-Driven Insights on revenue, loyalty, and customer retention..
📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a real-world, end-to-end data analytics workflow — showing how raw retail data can be transformed into meaningful insights and smarter business decisions.

The process includes:

✅ Data Preparation, Modeling & EDA (Python): Cleaned and transformed the dataset for analysis, handled missing values, and explored key patterns.

✅ Data Analysis (SQL): Ran business-oriented queries to understand customer segments, loyalty trends, and purchase behavior.

✅ Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Designed an interactive dashboard to highlight key metrics, revenue trends, and customer patterns that help guide marketing and retention strategies.

✅ Reporting & Presentation: Wrote a concise business report and built a presentation deck summarizing insights and actionable recommendations.
